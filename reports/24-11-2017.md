# A Region of Interest System

Since James has been developing new editorial methods for a digital medium (even prior to coming to the project of SQE), it was asked whether Bronson Brown Devost could have an example of the method. Bronson asked Peter Porzig for an example of the method, and Peter agreed that he would work up an example on 4Q51. Bronson asked Peter for the example under the condition that Bronson would use this method on his work on 4Q51. Instead, Bronson brought this method into the data model of SQE, and did not consult with James about proper attribution of his method. James devised the method for work on his doctoral thesis at the University of Toronto. It should not go without notice that the model was created by James M. Tucker, and should be acknolwedged as much in the framework of SQE.
