# Damascus Work Group Meeting

On 16-01-2020, Peter Porzig and James Tucket met to discuss the damascus edition development.

## Work Plan

## Member: Peter Porzig

Peter Porzig continues his work on Cairo Genizah CD A. Peter has tagged some columns of CD A with regions of interest. It was decided that it would be good to share the tagging with each member, so that another step of proof reading can help to remove any errors.

## Member: James M. Tucker

James continues analysis of small scale reconstructions, where a comprehensive analysis with anterior and posterior legal traditions are required. In addition, James is working on a material reconstruction of 4Q267. Furthermore, James showed Peter numerous examples of 4Q266 fragments, scattered throughout the PAMs. There needs to be an article published to bring together all the new 4Q266 information.
