# Editorial Report: Damascus Covenant 10-01-2020
The following report was given in the SQE GÃ¶ttingen Internal Team Meeting. In this meeting the Tech Team (Bronson Brown devost and Ingo Kottsieper) gave a report of the technical developments in the project, outsourced to the Chelem Company. The Editorial Team of _Damascus Covenant_ (James M. Tucker and Peter Porzig) also reported on their progress.

## CD A
Peter Porzig reported that he was working on transcribing the Medieval Codex of CD A. In the last meeting of SQE (19.09.2019), Ingo Kottsieper and Bronson Brown devost informed Peter and James that "CD" would be separated into CD A and CD B, per the editorial needs of the editors (see also the request made in [Redmine on 19.08.2019](https://www.qumranica.org/redmine/issues/322) and [printed ticket attached](/reports/docs/#322.pdf)). It was disclosed in the meeting on 10-01-2020, that this work has not been accomplished to date.

## Legal Issues and Reconstructions
James Tucker reported that he is working on issues of small scale reconstruction, where a careful comparison with the Hebrew Bible and Rabbinic Literature is required. This takes extensive amounts of time, for the issues need to be analysed and annotated within a scholarly context of a digital edition.

## Damascus Book
The question was raised about editions of a Damascus Covenant. Since we still do not have a workspace to produce material reconstructions, Peter Porzig and James Tucker have decided to work on a print edition. It was agreed that digital rights of the transcriptions shall remain with SQE. Reinhard Kratz gave permission to seek a publisher for a printed edition.
