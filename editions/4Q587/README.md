# 4Q587 A Newly Identified Fragment of Damascus

By tagging all the PAM images, it is necessary to take a full account of where fragments exist in the PAM images. For the specialist in DSS studies, this is an obvious requirement. For the non-specialist, the reason to account for the fragments throughout all the PAM images is because the fragments would continue to decay over time, were sometimes arranged differently, and various other reasons. When James M. Tucker was tagging the PAM images, he flagged PAM frag. 43.196, 43.681, and 44.102 as having an unidentified fragment of Damascus. Analysis of the text with CD A 7:6–13 and CD B 1:1–9 has provided sufficient reason to consider this fragment an attestion to the Damascus Document. James has assigned it the siglum of 4Q587 (4QDamascus<sup>i</sup>).
